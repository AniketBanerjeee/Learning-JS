// console.log(2 > 3);
// this is basic number check this is normal easy and common.


// console.log("2" == 2); // output is true
// for this string two is getting converted and bcz the both are 2 it will show true

console.log("2" === 2); // output is false
// === is strict check it not only check the value also check the datatype so diffent datatype that's why it's false



// console.log(null > 0);
// console.log(undefined > 0);
// comparison in null and undefined mostly we are avoid this bcz this give us confusion.
